        <p>Learning languages is a fun and rewarding way to learn about other cultures and enrich our lives beyond what we already know and experience on a daily basis. Learning a second or third language improves our understanding of our native language and allows us to realise things about our own culture that we may not have recognised before. When learning the Japanese language in particular, we clearly appreciate how language is used to communicate in different social settings such as communicating with friends, co-workers, employers, customers/clients and family. More interestingly, it is also said that knowing two or more languages decreases your chance of developing mental illness like Alzheimer’s later in life – bonus!</p>

        <p>At Julala's Tuition, learning Japanese is both enjoyable and practical as we cater for those who wish to learn for leisure and for those studying at primary, secondary and tertiary levels. Lessons are executed using a variety of materials and often make use of multimedia activities, games, role-plays and the like.</p>

        <p>Julia, our Director, studied Japanese at the Australian National University in Canberra and received her bachelor degree in Asian Studies in 2003. Since then, she has taught both privately and in secondary schools, helping a variety of students gain outstanding results at school and become proficient in conversational Japanese.</p>

        <p>If you are having trouble with any aspect of the Japanese language as you study for your HSC or at university, Julia can help you clearly understand all grammar and kanji so you can achieve the best possible marks for your Japanese course – it’s actually really easy!</p>

        <p>Lessons are available to be conducted within your home, in our St Ives studio or through Skype. Below is a list of our lesson fees for Japanese:</p>

        <p>Julala's Tuition provides high quality piano and theory lessons incorporating a variety of activities which stimulate and motivate each student’s aspiration for learning. Lessons include a variety of activities such as rhythm reading, sight reading, aural exercises, repertoire development, performance training and music theory – all of which encourage the development of a well-rounded musician.</p>

        <p>Learning music has a number of benefits and is a fun and rewarding activity. Playing a musical instrument is a magnificent skill to have and it has the ability to make significant improvements relating to memory, learning and social interactions.</p>

        <p>Music lessons at Julala’s Tuition are often complimented with further fortnightly, monthly or holiday group theory classes. These classes offer an even more fun and social learning environment in which games, trivia, and reward-based study incentives are utilised to encourage even more motivation from our students. For the more serious learner we use these sessions to prepare for examinations. Please email us if you would like further information about the theory component of your child’s piano study.</p>

        <p>Each year we hold at least one piano recital for students to gain performance experience. Not only does this give parents and family the opportunity to see their child perform what they’ve been learning and practicing over a period of time, it also helps develop more confidence and can be a great practice run for those taking exams.</p>

        <p>At Julala's Tuition we cater for each student individually and offer our greatest assistance to be sure that each learner is able to reach their goals to the best of their ability.</p>

        <p>Piano lessons are usually once a week for 30 minutes at Malabar, Paddington or St Ives. Taking lessons within your home is also an option however availability is extremely limited. Please find our fee schedule below.</p>
